## My design manifesto
This term in Human Computer Interaction has shown me the importance of the design process in developing software. The design process is a systematic series of tasks that help define, plan, and yield products of usefulness and effectiveness. The process presents developers with a refined method for guaranteeing an engaging user experience. It demonstrates that a development team has identified more than one possible solution to a problem, has explored and scrutinized a variety of approaches and understandings, and has conducted in-depth research in sight of achieving the objective. In all, the design process sets clear expectations, puts clients at ease, diminishes the risk of mishap and failure, and greatly increases the likelihood that what’s being created will be successful.

### Identify the problem
Before we set out on a journey towards accomplishing something, we must first identify a problem. What’s the point of doing what we’re about to do? Sure we could spin up a major project on the cunning edge of technology, but would doing so would actually benefit us or someone else? Oftentimes engineers will spend months developing technically-sound projects that have little to no purpose in the real world. An excellent software development team will spend months designing a project before even beginning the implementation process. Every single project needs a concrete definition of a worthwhile and evident problem it seeks to solve. My team designed a mobile library website for tourists in [Design for others](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/designing-for-tourists-816e20fdb741), providing intelligently pertinent information that would otherwise go unseen. In [Design for tension](https://medium.com/@DillonBordeleau/a-politically-intelligent-chatbot-4b700ac9d098), my team developed a chatbot that alleviated political policy discord with a dynamic stream of unbiased political literature. Every project I took part in this term had a defined objective that stemmed from the recognition of a particular problem. Any team’s work towards a loosely founded goal will prove frivolous and misdirected without a strong problem statement.
