## My design manifesto
**by Dillon Bordeleau** *dtbordeleau at wpi dot edu*

This term in Human Computer Interaction has shown me the importance of the design process in developing software. The design process is a systematic series of tasks that help define, plan, and yield products of usefulness and effectiveness. The process presents developers with a refined method for guaranteeing an engaging user experience. It demonstrates that a development team has identified more than one possible solution to a problem, has explored and scrutinized a variety of approaches and understandings, and has conducted in-depth research in sight of achieving the objective. In all, the design process sets clear expectations, puts clients at ease, diminishes the risk of mishap and failure, and greatly increases the likelihood that what’s being created will be successful.

### Identify the problem

Before we set out on a journey towards accomplishing something, we must first identify a problem. What’s the point of doing what we’re about to do? Sure we could spin up a major project on the cunning edge of technology, but would doing so would actually benefit us or someone else? Oftentimes engineers will spend months developing technically-sound projects that have little to no purpose in the real world. An excellent software development team will spend months designing a project before even beginning the implementation process. Every single project needs a concrete definition of a worthwhile and evident problem it seeks to solve. My team designed a mobile library website for tourists in [Design for others](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/designing-for-tourists-816e20fdb741), providing intelligently pertinent information that would otherwise go unseen. In [Design for tension](https://medium.com/@DillonBordeleau/a-politically-intelligent-chatbot-4b700ac9d098), my team developed a chatbot that alleviated political policy discord with a dynamic stream of unbiased political literature. Every project I took part in this term had a defined objective that stemmed from the recognition of a particular problem. Any team’s work towards a loosely founded goal will prove frivolous and misdirected without a strong problem statement.

### Consider possible solutions
![Design for understanding graph sketch](/assets/understanding1.jpg)

Any given problem will always have a breath of possible solutions. Some solutions will be direct but too simple or light, some solutions will be comprehensive but too complicated or heavy. Every solution we’ll come across will in one way or another address the problem at hand. At this stage in the design process, it is important to leave our options and paths open. There’s no need to constraint our direction by honing in on one particular solution proposal just yet. Each proposal will have its own pros and cons, its own bells and whistles, its own character that needs to be considered in a critical light. [Design for understanding](https://medium.com/@tberg1234/design-for-understanding-25a38dcd7d3c) lended itself both to the flexibility and constraints of Vega, a Javascript-based visualization grammar where the number of viable visualization options was endless. [Design for wellbeing](https://medium.com/@brianrojas_78421/design-for-well-being-distractions-357ca3bf3b72) entered the world of emotion-enabled computing and in doing so shed light on an environment so complex that even Affectiva has yet to master it. There are hundreds if not thousands of ways to approach any given problem - it’s the designer’s job to pick the best one.

### Identify the best solution
![Design for others solution sketch](/assets/others1.png)

A considerable amount of time should be spent identifying the best possible conceptual solution to a given problem. For that matter, even defining the words “best solution” in the context of each project should take time. Every project will follow an entirely unique path to successful completion. Whether the best solution is the most streamlined, the most comprehensive, or the most straightforward, it will always present a team with the best possible chance at achieving its objective. Understandably, our definition of the words “best solution” will vary greatly from project to project. A team needs to not only concretely define their vision of an optimal solution in this step, but too identify an actual embodiment of it. Our [Design for others](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/designing-for-tourists-816e20fdb741) concept brought deeply nested information to light. The information we included was the best possible composite of all the available information we canvased. Effectively, our curated collection of relevant information presented itself as the best conceptual solution to our problem.

### Design a technical prototype

Even the most perfect of solutions can be fruitless without a period of thoughtful technical designing. There are as many potential technical solutions to any problem as there are conceptual solutions. At this stage in the design process, we’ve already spent considerable time developing a sound conceptualization of our best solution to our identified problem. Now is the time to spend an equivalent amount of time designing our technical solution’s implementation. Software engineers know better than anyone else that code without sound design is hardly code worth publishing. In collaborative spaces, code is expected to function effectively and transparently in adhering closely to a well defined interfacing. Functionality straying from this mapping often insights confusion and chaos that could easily have been avoided. We designed straightforward source files in [Design for wellbeing](https://medium.com/@brianrojas_78421/design-for-well-being-distractions-357ca3bf3b72) and [Design for another world](https://medium.com/@winnycheng/design-for-another-world-wizard-chess-a0db65fe5aba), allowing for function flexibility and collaborative effeciency.

### Implement the prototype

The concluding step of my design manifesto is to finally implement the technical prototype. At this stage in the process we have not only a sound conceptual solution, but too a strong technical solution off which to base our development. Our code will prove efficient, structured, and easy to understand. It will too follow the rigid guidelines of our established prototype. A project can still be botched at this stage of the design process if all of the work done thus far is abandoned. Weeks or even months of work has prepared us for a smooth and purposed implementation. While software engineers certainly are encouraged to adopt a poetic license at this stage in their development, any work they do stems entirely from the work of the designers and engineers before them. [Design for others](https://medium.com/@ilanazeldin/designing-for-tourists-816e20fdb741) proved a direct implementation of our established prototype. Without the days of thought and consideration we put into our ideation, this implementation simply would not have been possible.

### In conclusion
A sound design manifesto lends itself to a sound software project, both conceptually and technically. First, in identifying a problem, a project gains real-world relevance and pertinence. Second, in considering all possible solutions, a development team canvasses the spectrum of conceptual ideation. Third, in identifying a best possible solution, the team adapts a fortified and complete approach to adhere to. Fourth, in designing a technical prototype, the team considers and addresses technical capability and capacity. Fifth, in implementing the prototype, a team develops an application backed by sound research, ideation, and modeling. In using this design manifesto, a software development team will adapt a sturdy, tried and true roadmap to a successful project.
