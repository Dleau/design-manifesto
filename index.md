## My design manifesto
This term in Human Computer Interaction has shown me the importance of the design process in developing software. The design process is a systematic series of tasks that help define, plan, and yield products of usefulness and effectiveness. The process presents developers with a refined method for guaranteeing an engaging user experience. It demonstrates that a development team has identified more than one possible solution to a problem, has explored and scrutinized a variety of approaches and understandings, and has conducted in-depth research in sight of achieving the objective. In all, the design process sets clear expectations, puts clients at ease, diminishes the risk of mishap and failure, and greatly increases the likelihood that what’s being created will be successful.
